# DumperForRoblox
So this project is intended for the offset dump on 24.10.2025
You need to launch Roblox and then run patterns.exe. Enter any place and wait, or rather, occasionally glance at the console; the script will display in Russian 'successful,' and a text file with signatures for your hooks or similar will be created in the directory where patterns.exe is located.


P.s The file will not update, only sometimes, and possibly not at all.
